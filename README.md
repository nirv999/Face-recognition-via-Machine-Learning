# Face-recognition-via-Machine-Learning
The project contains classic pure ML (no CV/DL use) algorithms and models such as PCA, SVM, Regression, etc.

In order to train a model we must obtain the right data, luckily we have AT&T Faces Database.
for your convience I've attached all the faces images on the "att faces" file.

for further explanation and more details you can read the following poster or play with the code ;)
